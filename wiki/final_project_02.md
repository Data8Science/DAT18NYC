## Objectives

* Start considering your final project ideas
* Submit some teaser ideas
* Get some feedback before we move on to step 2!

## Project proposals

You'll be submitting three potential ideas for your final projects. You can drop these in as a text or markdown file. For each, I want you to explain the follow things:

1. In one/two sentences, describe the data problem
2. Where is the data coming from? How easy can you access it? Have you looked at this data before or not? Is it public or from your work?
3. What are the techniques you're expecting to use to solve this problem?
4. Hypothesis: What do you think are the potential leading indicators?

## Duedate

This is due one week from today (Next Thursday). The earlier, the better, so you can get feedback asap!

## Wait, a final project?

You can get all the information for the final project [here](https://github.com/podopie/data_science_class_examples/wiki/FinalProject_00:-Details).
