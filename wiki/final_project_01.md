##FINAL PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

Address a data-related problem in your professional field or in a field you're interested in. Pick a subject that you're passionate about; if you're strongly interested in the subject matter it'll be more fun for you and you'll probably produce a better project! Apply modeling techniques (regression, recommendation, classification, etc.) and data analysis principles (cross-validation, caution against overfitting, etc.) and report your results.


## PRESENTATIONS (LAST DAY OF CLASS):
On the last day of class, all students are required to give a 5 – 7 minute presentation that summarizes their data results.  The presentations should target a non-technical audience and serve the purpose of having students practice the highly sought after communication skills that data scientists need.

What to cover in presentation:

* Overview of problem and hypothesis
* Overview of data
* Modeling techniques used and why
* What decisions your findings allow you to make.


###GRADING:

* **EXCELLENT**: Student's presentation is engaging, clear, and informative, describing the project, approach, and conclusions, and is suitable for a non-technical audience.

* **GOOD**: Student's presentation is as above but is either inadequately engaging, clear, or informative. 

* **FAIR**: Student's presentation fails on two out of three of engaging, clear, and informative. 

* **POOR**: Student's presentation fails on all three or is off-topic with respect to his or her paper. 


##PAPER: (4 - 6 PAGES) 

Students are also required to submit a 4 – 6 page paper that describes the project’s technical details.  The paper should target a technical audience.
What to cover in paper:

* Description of problem and hypothesis.
* Detailed description your data set. 
* How did you decide what features to use in your analysis? 
* What challenges did you face in terms of obtaining and organizing the data? 
* Describe what kinds of statistical methods you used, and perhaps others you considered but did not use, and how you decided what to use. 
* What business applications do your findings have? 


###GRADING:
* **EXCELLENT**:    Student's paper demonstrates thorough understanding of statistical techniques, data management, and the application of these in programming, and is clearly communicated to a reasonably technical audience. 
* **GOOD**: Student's paper demonstrates above knowledge, but lacks some necessary rigor, detail, and/or exploratory depth or is not well communicated. 
* **FAIR**: Student's paper demonstrates some learning of principles taught in class, but is clearly lacking in rigor and/or depth. 
* **POOR**:     Student's paper is incomplete or does not conclusively demonstrate understanding of statistics or programming.
