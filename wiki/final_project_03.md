## Objectives

* Finalize your project conceptually
* Begin digging through data
* Show some initial understanding of data relationships and what you are attempting to build


## Part 1: Outline

Initially your goal is to construct an outline of your project in futher detail. This should look very loose, but provide structure to your project. The goals here are to:

* Explain your project in more detail
* Cover the "what": provide more detail about the data you're working with, the features you have, and the range of your problem.
* Cover the "how": Where is the data coming from, and how are you getting it? What will your data mining process look like in order to create new data or structure? What algorithms do you plan on using, and why are you making those choices given your understanding of how they work?

> Ex: I'm primarily working with text data, so I will be designing a dictionary to focus around of words, trialing both a work frequency approach dropping stop words and a tf-idf matrix, which will then be put through a Random Forests classifier to produce the clearest accuracy and results.


## Part 2: Data Mining and Understanding

For this section we need to see some number crunching of which you best understand the relationships of the data you are working with. The expectation is for you to include **at least three (3)** charts of your choice that you think best show something of value abotu your data, and for each include a brief explanation of what we're looking at and what it means for your data collection and project.

How you want to make these are up to you, however it's suggested to continue practicing with matplotlib (or learn how to use ggplot for python) to "gain" the most from your work. Feel free to just use a screenshot application or learn how to create pdfs or images from your code.

Please submit the outline as a text or markdown file, and include the rest as an attachment.

## Due Date:
This will be due one week from today (October 29th). Although this is one full week, be well advised that you should be full on in work mode on your final project by Thursday night after we close up submissions on the two "competitions" (the regressions and classification problems).
