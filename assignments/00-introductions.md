# Introductions
*Due Date: 1/28/2015*

Please write up a short introduction about yourself using the markdown language. Your introduction should include:

1. Name
2. Current "What I do during the day" status (work, student, mine bitcoins, etc)
3. A few examples of data you're interested in working with, or have worked with in the past
4. Why you signed up for the data science course
5. An interesting blog post or website that is data oriented that you recently read or found.

For those unfamiliar with markdown syntax, Github has a fantastic [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) to bookmark. Keep markdown in mind as some of the tools we will be using in class is powered by it!
