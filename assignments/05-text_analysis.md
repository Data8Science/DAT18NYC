# Text Analysis
*Due Date: 3/9/2015*

This week we've run down an overview on a variety of tools and approaches to handling and processing text.

## Objective

Using the dataset from Wednesday's lecture, build the best model to predicting if a movie will be fresh or not fresh.

Put together a notebook that addresses:

* additional data cleanup
* approach you took and how you determined that approach
* end result: showing off the classifier

As mentioned in class, steps you should be considering:

1. Consider feature selection here: we haven't dropped a single feature! How could we evaluate this process? (check out `f_classif`)
2. Last class we experiments with nltk and the part of speach tagger. Consider replacing words with parts of speach instead (using the default tagger), or other text processing tools (remove the stopwords... or just keep the stopwords!)
3. What else is in the quote that we could identify and replace more easily?

## Grading

We are primarily observing:

#### How well can you code through your problems?

[1] minimal effort beyond what we did in class. Objectively you're showing us that you at least understand how the code we used in class worked.

[2] exploring elements of text analysis and understand results. Objectively, you've tried a few things and can explain why they worked or didn't work (or rather, why they either contributed or did not contribute) to your end model. You may have toyed with the base variations of classifier learners.

[3] full exploration of the material: everything from this week you picked up well, applied to a previous knowledge, and created reasonable work. Expecting to see more creative features and processes to model optimization

#### How well do you understand the theory?

[1] Akin to [1] above, we'd be expecting work similar to copy paste and good guesses on why things work the way they work

[2] you've attempted to explain why your model works the way it does rationally. There may be some error to the logic.

[3] Some kind of deep dive into explaining why your model is the best model (or why your model didn't succeed) shows you understand the theory behind the last few lessons in class. In particular, paying attention to a few particular features and their effects overall help a lot. The vernacular coincides with material from class.
