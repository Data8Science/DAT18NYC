## Active Code Reading

Actively participating in reading code can help you better understand what each line, function, or script is doing. Think of it like asking "what does this do?" while you read code to yourself.

1. Copy and Paste doesn't learn code. Typing does.
    * teach your fingers the code. It'll help your brain become more familiar with what it's doing.
2. Comment above each line of code as you enter it.
    * Try guessing what the code does before you run it, and leave that as a comment
    * Run the code
    * Did it run what you expected? Update your code comment to fit your new explanation
    * Try getting your explanation to look as close to a mix of English and the code as possible. For example:
        - `return 1 if a > 2 else 3`: return the number 1 if the variable a is less than 2, otherwise, return 3
3. Try changing values or arguments and run again.
    * Did you get an error? What did the error mean? (read the last line)
    * What changed? Document it.
    * Update your original comment as needed.
4. Find the documentation for the code, if there is any. Does it make sense? Is it similar to what you wrote?
5. Add to your comments: when would you need to do something like what the code did?
6. If you're not sure what a variable is equal to in a function or for loop, try adding a print line before the code and run it. See what it outputs, then update your comment.
