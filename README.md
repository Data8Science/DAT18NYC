### Assignments

#### Instructions
Instructions for each assignment is listed in the [assignments folder](assignments/). Each assignment will explain details, goals, where to find the data if necessary, and a benchmark rubric for personal alignment.

All assignments are introduced on Wednesdays and due the coming Monday. Instructors will provide feedback before the coming Wednesday class.

There are no assignments when there are project presentations coming up.

#### Grading

All weekly assignments are graded on completion only. We understand that students can't always get to everything, or can't always put in 100% effort due to life, work, etc. We will, however, provide feedback to all submitted work, and a placement on the rubric, if there was one. You are always more than welcome to resubmit work, though our priority for feedback will always be what is upcoming.

#### Submitting

* Linkable assignments, such as gists, can be submitted by posting to [this submission form](http://goo.gl/forms/qLHIjZadnp). We highly recommend using git to checkin your work, as it's a great starting point to a portfolio, but other formats are fine (a blog post you wrote up, a gist, file/archive through google drive or dropbox)

### Projects

#### Instructions
Instructions for each project is listed in the [projects folder](projects/). Each project will explain details, goals, and a grading rubric.

Consider the three projects as **one long project**, as the projects should build on top of each other, and show an evolution of work. You are primarily being graded on this evolution, so keep that in mind!

#### Grading

While assignments are graded on a check system, projects are graded via a rubric. We'll review the rubrics as projects are introduced.

#### Submitting

Please use the same google form for assignments.
